# 4.2 Objectives and Tools

## Key Principles for Programmers
Our job as programmers is to express computatons:
- **Correctly**
- **Simply**
- **Efficiently** 

> **Note**: The order is important: 
> - Correctness comes first - a program is useless if it produces incorrect results
> - Simplicity matters because even a correct and efficient program can fail if it's too complicated to maintain or modify. 

## Why Simplicity Matters
Programs will inevitably need to be modified:
- To accomodate **new requirements**, **new hardware**, or other changes.
- A messy program structure makes updates like changing the user interface or natural language **difficult or impossible**. 

**Example:**
If you write a messy program for teaching arithmetic to kids in your local shcool, and someone wants to translate it into another language (e.g., Finnish or Arabic), poor structure could make that change nearly **impossible**.

## Professional Responsibility
- **Good programmers focus on structure and quality of code.** 
- Throwing code together to make it *work* is **not enough**.
- Well-structured code minimises **debugging time** and **reduces errors** during development.

##Main Tools for Organising Programs
To handle large computations, we break them down into smaller parts using two key techniques:

### 1. **Abstraction**
- **Hide implementation details** behind a general, convenient interface.
- Example: sorting a phone book
    - Instead of writing a custom sorting algorithm, call the **C++ standard library sort function**: `sort(b)`  
    - We don't need to know the sorting details, only how to call it. 

- **Other abstraction examples:** 
    - Accessing memory through **typed and named variables** instead of direct memory manipulation.
    - Using **vectors** (C++ standard library) to manage collections of data. 

### 2. **Divide and Conquer**
- Break large problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Example: Building a dictionary can be divided into:
1. Reading the data
2. Sorting the data
3. Outputting the results

--- 

## Why Break Problems Down? 
- We are **not good at handling large, complex problems** directly.
- Smaller parts are easier to **understand, debug, and maintain**.
- A 1000-line program will often have **more than 10x the errors** of a 100-line program. 
- For large-scale programs (e.g, 10 million lines), abstraction and divide-and-conquer are **essential**. 

## The Role of Libraries
- Libraries **provide tools and abstractions** that helo break programs into parts.
- **Good libraries** reduce programming, testing and documentation work. 
**Example:**  
- The **C++ standard library**’s `iostream` lets us manage input and output without directly interacting with hardware.

--- 

## Why Structure Matters
- Writing good code is **not just about writing a lot of statements**.
- **Structure and organisation** are critical for long-term success.
- **Without structure**, programs become expensive messes that are difficult to maintain. 

> **Analogy**
> Building software without structure is like building with **mud bricks**. It's possible, but you'll never get to the fifth floor. Proper structure is necessary for building durable, scalable systems.

 --- 
## Final Takeaway
- **Don’t ignore code structure while learning.**  
- The “softer” aspects of programming (like structure and design) are just as important as learning syntax or algorithms.  
- **Good structure** prevents failure and reduces long-term costs.
