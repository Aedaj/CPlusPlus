//We name our variables so that we can remember them and refer to them. A name starts with a letter and only contains letters, digits and underscores.

//Dont do this shit: 
#include <iostream>
#include<string>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;

//int 2x; 
double time$to$market;
//char start menu; 
int string = 7; 


//Pretty self-explanatory tho
